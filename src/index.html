            <h2>Designs. Displays. Props. I love 'em!</h2>
            I design a variety of objects and make them with a variety materials for a variety of people. Whether it
            be private clients,
            well known brand names or commercial businesses. Imagining and manufacturing objects, varying in size
            and
            purpose, whatever the brief, I endeavor to create beautifully simple work within which form and function
            are equal entities. I have also worked as part of larger teams creating some pretty phenomenal
            installations.
            These include
            <b>Vevo</b>,
            <b>NME</b> and
            <b>Virgin Trains</b>. My work has previously been recognized and supported by brands such as Anglepoise
            and
            Kvadrat fabrics. My creations have also featured at music events and marketing campaigns across the UK.
            <br>
            <br>If you would like to know more about what I can do for you, feel free to send me an email or invite
            me out
            for coffee... I would love to talk!
